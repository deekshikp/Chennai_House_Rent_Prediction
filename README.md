# Chennai House Rent Prediction
* In our project Chennai House Rent Prediction, we tried to help people looking for rental homes by predicting the rent price with respect to various parameters. It will be highly beneficial for people especially in financial point of view. 

* We used the data science approach to answer data driven questions we have to answer by the end of the project. 

* We collected the data from a website called magicbricks.com. We then processed it and removed unnecessary values from the dataset. As the next step we Exploratory Data Analysis over the dataset. 

* Finally, we built two machine learning models over the dataset. We tried to predict rental price of the house using Linear Regression. We tried to classify the houses using a Support Vector Machine. 

* House rent price prediction can help the landlord to determine the right rental price by not over pricing and underpricing. It can help the tenant to rightfully be aware of the actual worth of the house and negotiate the pricing.
